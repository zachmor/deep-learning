achieved > 400 for both models. 
bugs:
 #1    repeated print-WARNING:tensorflow:Gradients do not exist for variables ['dense/kernel:0', 'dense/bias:0', 'dense_1/kernel:0', 'dense_1/bias:0'] when minimizing the loss.
 #2    repeated print-WARNING:tensorflow:11 out of the last 11 calls to <function ReinforceWithBaseline.call at 0x138e70620> triggered tf.functionretracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings is likely due to passing python objects instead of tensors. Also, tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
